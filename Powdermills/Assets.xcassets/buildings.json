		"history": "The original gunpowder mills had 4 Incorporating Mills. This was increased to 12 Incorporating mills by the next owners, the British Board of Ordnance, and finally to 24 Incorporating Mills by the third owners, Tobin & Horsfall.",
		"function": "An Incorporating Mill finely ground a mixture of saltpetre, sulphur and charcoal together to product crude gunpowder. The process used two heavy millstones to carry out the operation. The millstones were rotated by a mechanical system powered by a water wheel.",
		"funFacts": "The original Incorporating Mills buildings were made of wood and have not survived. The building you see today is a modern reconstruction built in 1993. The large stone walls you see in the Incorporating Mills area are blast walls to prevent an explosion in one set of the incorporating mills spreading to neighbouring incorporating mills.",

		"name": "Charcoal Mill",
		"history": "The charcoal mill was constructed by the original gunpowder mills owner Charles Henry Leslie in 1794. It continued to be used until the gunpowder mills were closed in 1903.",
		"function": "Charcoal was prepared from lengths of wood about 60 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter. They were heated in a very hot oven in a building called the Charcoal Burning House and then crushed and  ground to a fine powder in the Charcoal Mill. A waterwheel was used to drive the milling machinery.",
		"funFacts": "Charcoal production in the ovens produced three other side products,Pyroligneous Acid, Tar and an Inflammable Gas. The Pyroligneous Acid was used as a wood preseravative, the Tar to coat the walls and floor of mill races to prevent erosion by the fast flowing water and the Infammable Gas was used to heat the charcoal ovens.",

		"history": "The Millwright was a specialist who worked to build, repair and maintain the various water mills on the site used for the manufacture of gunpowder. The Carpenter built and repaired wooden buildings and structures. The Copper Store was used to store supplies of copper for tools and other items made of copper. Copper needed to be stored separately to ensure no iron materials were mixed with it.",
		"function": "The Millwright maintained the 20 Water powered process units on the site. There were about 33 wooden buildings on the site that were maintained by the carpenters. Machinery on the site also had wooden components that required maintainance by carpenters. Copper was the chosen metal for tools, screws, nails and hammers as it would not cause a spark in use. It needed to be carefully segregated from iron materials for  safety reasons.",

		"history": "A Cooper was a skilled craftsman who made barrels for gunpowder storage, or other wooden waterproof storage containers. The barrels were manufactured in a Cooperage building.",
		"function": "Gunpowder, both, in partly manufactured form and finished form was stored in watertight barrels. Each barrel was made up of about 8 specially shaped pieces of wood called staves to make the body of the barrel and 6-8 specially shaped pieces of wood for the top and bottom of the barrel. The barrel was held together by wooden hoops.  The standard barrel for gunpowder for sale contained about 45 kg of gunpowder.",
		"funFacts": "About 50 Coopers were employed at the Gunpowder Mills. No iron could be used anywhere in the construction of the barrel because of the danger of a spark being created by scraping the iron on stone, or grit.",

A sawmill  existed on the site since about 1807. A new sawmill was built around 1870 to supplement the output of the original sawmill.",
		"function": "At peak production in the Ballincollig Gunpowder Mills about 80 gunpowder storage barrels needed to be produced per day. The new sawmill was powered by an internal combustion engine, the only nonwater powered machinery on the site.",

		"history": "The Saltpetre (whose chemical name is 'Potassium Nitrate') used in the Ballincollig gunpowder mills was obtained from Bengal, in east India.  Saltpetre is a natural material produced by bacterial decomposition of animal waste. An impure Saltpetre was imported. The Saltpetre refinery needed to purify the material so that it was 99.99% pure to be suitable for use in gunpowder manufacture.",
		"function": "The refinery process consisted of  dissolving the Saltpetre in hot water, removing small stones and earth by passing the hot liquid through a filter and then allowed the hot liquid to cool. The cooling caused crystals of pure Saltpetre to form. The crystals were then removed from the cold liquid.",
		"funFacts": "Gunpowder consisted of 75% of Saltpetre. About 4,000 kg of pure Saltpetre were required to be refined per day.",

This was to mimimise dust formed in the Incorporation process and to act as a binder for the incorporated gunpowder. The added water need to be removed in the last stage of the gunpowder manufacturing process.",
		"function": "Water was boiled in a copper vessel to produce steam using a coal fire to heat the water. The steam produced was fed through a pipe system to a gunpowder drying room. The pipes in the drying room were similar to a domestic radiator. The gunpowder to be dried was placed in open shallow trays and dried for a number of hours before being put into barrels for storage in the Gunpowder Magazine.",

		"name": "Glazing House",
		"history": "Glazing is a process that removed rough edges from the corned gunpowder. Without this process the gunpowder pieces would rub together on transport and creat gunpowder dust . This mixture of gunpowder granules and gunpowder powder would make the explosion of the gunpowder unpredictable when it was used.",
		"function": "Following the corning process, gunpowder was ‘glazed’. For certain grades of gunpowder a small quantity of powdered graphite was added for improved smoothness and moisture resistance.",

This was done to mimimise the risk of explosion while moving the material from process to process. The Powder Boats, as they were called, were pulled by a pony with a harness connected to the powder boat by a rope and steered by a gunpowderman in the boat.",
